# GRAPH-RECOMMENDATION-C

This is basically a graph based recommendation system .

If neighbour A knows neighbour B and neighbour B knows neighbour C

then a transitive relation is made between A and C .

Basically , directed edges are made between neighbours A -> B indicating A knows B and vice versa is not true.

All neighbours get their recommended partner in the society with whom they can group in.

Rating(personality marks) are also allocated to each person so that only person with higher rating get recommended
